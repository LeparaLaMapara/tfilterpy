The **TFiterPy** is a Python package for implementing the Bayesian filter algorithms, that are widely used mathematical tools in estimation theory and control engineering. It can be used to estimate the state of a linear system in the presence of random noise.

## Installation

To install the TFiterPy package, you can use pip, the package installer for Python. Open a terminal and type the following command:

``` 
pip install TFiterPy
```
