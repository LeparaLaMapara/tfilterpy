The **tfilterspy** package is a Python library for implementing Bayesian filter algorithms, widely used mathematical tools in estimation theory and control engineering.

## Installation

You can install the **tfilterspy** package via pip, the Python package installer. Open a terminal and type the following command:

  ```shell  
  pip install tfilterspy
  ```

### Supported Methods
Currently, the following Bayesian filter algorithms are implemented in **tfilterspy**:

- **Kalman Filters**: A class of linear estimators used in filtering and smoothing applications.
- **Particle Filters**: A family of sequential Monte Carlo methods used for sampling from posterior distributions.

More methods will be added in the future.

## Usage
Here's are examples of how to use **tfilterspy** to estimate the state of a noisy linear system using a Kalman filter in the  [example](https://github.com/LeparaLaMapara/tfilterpy/blob/main/examples/).
